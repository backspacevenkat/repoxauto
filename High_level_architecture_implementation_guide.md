Xauto Architecture & Implementation Guide
Overview
Xauto is a multi-account Twitter management and automation platform. It supports both "Normal" and "Worker" Twitter accounts, performing actions like scraping profiles, retrieving tweets, posting tweets, liking, retweeting, sending DMs, changing profiles, and tracking various analytics. The system must handle rate limits, account validation, proxy usage, and large-scale workflows involving multiple accounts and tasks.

This document outlines the recommended architecture, including frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure components. It also details key modules, data flows, and best practices for scalability and maintainability.

High-Level Architecture
Key Components:

Frontend Dashboard (Web UI)

Built using a modern JS framework (e.g., Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS or Material UI).
Provides responsive, mobile-friendly UI for:
Account management (viewing, adding, validating accounts)
Task creation & monitoring (scraping tasks, tweet posting, likes, retweets, DMs)
Analytics & metrics (account performance, followers, engagement)
Workflow configuration and monitoring
Backend API Layer (FastAPI)

Exposes a RESTful and WebSocket-based API.
Authentication & Authorization for the dashboard.
Orchestrates tasks, accesses the database, enforces rate limits, and interacts with the queue.
Hosts endpoints for:
Account CRUD operations
Task submission, status queries, and results
Querying analytics and logs
Triggering validation and recovery flows
Task Processing & Queue System (Celery + Redis or RQ + Redis)

Asynchronous workers to handle heavy or time-delayed tasks:
Scraping actions
Tweet posting, retweeting, liking, DMing
Batch operations across multiple accounts
Task priority and scheduling to respect rate limits and daily quotas.
Automatic retries and error handling.
Integrates with proxy management and rate-limiting logic.
Database (PostgreSQL)

Stores all persistent data:
Accounts, credentials, proxy info, validation status, rate-limit counters.
Tasks, task logs, and results.
Tweet metadata, scraped content, and analytics.
Utilizes migrations (Alembic) to evolve the schema.
Uses efficient indexing and relationships to handle large datasets.
Proxies & Rate Limiting Services

A dedicated module or microservice to select and apply correct proxies per account request.
Centralized rate limiter that consults database counters and ensures no action violates Twitter’s constraints.
Dynamic backoff and scheduling (e.g., if an action hits a rate limit, queue it for future execution).
Authentication & Security

Securely store API keys, access tokens, and cookies in a secrets manager or encrypted in the DB.
Use OAuth 2.0 for the dashboard and secure endpoints.
Integrate 2FA code generation for Twitter login flows when required.
Monitoring & Logging

Centralized logging (e.g., Loguru / structlog) with JSON output.
Dashboards for metrics (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana) to monitor rate limits, errors, task throughput.
WebSocket push updates to the frontend for real-time task status and account health changes.
Suggested Technology Stack
Frontend:
Next.js (React) for SSR and SPA features.
Tailwind CSS or Material UI for rapid UI design.
WebSockets (native in browser) or Next.js API routes for streaming updates.
Backend:
Python 3.11+ for performance and async features.
FastAPI for REST and WebSocket endpoints.
Async client libraries: httpx or aiohttp for calling Twitter APIs.
Task Queue:
Celery or RQ as the task queue processor.
Redis as the in-memory broker and result store.
Database:
PostgreSQL 14+
SQLAlchemy 2.0 for ORM.
Alembic for migrations.
Deployment:
Docker + Docker Compose for local development.
Kubernetes (optional, future scaling) for production.
Database Schema Design
Core Tables:

accounts

id: PK
account_no: Unique Internal ID
act_type: ENUM('Normal', 'Worker')
login: String (Twitter username)
password, email, email_password: Encrypted strings
auth_token, ct0, two_fa_code: For login sessions
proxy_url, proxy_port, proxy_username, proxy_password
user_agent
consumer_key, consumer_secret, bearer_token, access_token, access_token_secret, client_id, client_secret
status: ENUM('active', 'suspended', 'locked', 'unknown')
last_validation: datetime
tasks

id: PK
type: ENUM('scrape_profile', 'scrape_tweets', 'like', 'retweet', 'quote_tweet', 'reply_tweet', 'post_tweet', 'dm', 'get_trends', 'search', 'change_profile', etc.)
input_params: JSONB (stores all input args)
created_at, scheduled_at, executed_at, status, error_log
priority: INT
assigned_account_id: FK to accounts
attempt_count: INT
result: JSONB (for output data)
rate_limits

id: PK
account_id: FK to accounts
action_type: String (e.g., 'scrape', 'like', 'tweet')
limit_window: ENUM('15min', '24h')
limit_used: INT (tracks usage)
limit_max: INT
reset_at: datetime (when the limit resets)
scraped_data (for storing scraped tweets, profiles, trends)

id: PK
account_id: FK to accounts (which account performed the scrape)
data_type: ENUM('profile', 'tweets', 'trends')
payload: JSONB (the raw data)
collected_at: datetime
notifications, dm_messages, tweet_metrics

Tables to store fetched notifications, DM transcripts, and historical tweet performance metrics.
Indexes & Constraints:

Index on accounts(account_no).
Index on tasks(status, priority).
Index on rate_limits(account_id, action_type).
Proper foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity.
Backend API Structure
Endpoints (FastAPI):

POST /accounts/import:

Input: CSV or JSON with account details.
Action: Bulk insert into accounts.
POST /accounts/validate:

Trigger validation routine (manual).
If run recently, returns cached status.
GET /accounts:

Lists accounts, status, last validation time.
POST /tasks/create:

Input: type, input_params, priority, account_selection.
Splits large tasks into sub-tasks if needed (e.g., scraping 10k accounts).
Enqueues tasks in Celery/RQ.
GET /tasks/status/{id}:

Returns task status, results.
POST /tasks/bulk_create:

For workflows that create multiple tasks at once (e.g., retweeting from multiple accounts).
GET /analytics/accounts:

Returns metrics about account performance, tweet engagement, etc.
GET /notifications/{account_id}:

Fetches cached notifications from DB or triggers a fetch task.
POST /profile/update:

Updates bio, profile photo, cover image for a given account.
GET /trends:

Returns cached trending topics from DB or triggers fetch if stale.
WebSockets:

GET /ws/status
Pushes task status updates, rate-limit warnings, new scraped data to the dashboard in real-time.
Authentication:

Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT-based auth for frontend users.
Store tokens safely.
Admin panel endpoints protected by roles/permissions.
Task Queue & Worker Design
Celery/RQ Workers:

Separate worker processes run tasks asynchronously.
Types of tasks:
Scrape Tasks: Get profiles, tweets, trends, search results.
Worker accounts perform these actions using assigned proxies.
Action Tasks: Like, retweet, reply, post tweets.
Normal accounts or worker accounts can do these depending on the task.
Validation Tasks: Periodically check and recover accounts.
Rate Limiting & Scheduling:

Before executing a task:
Check rate_limits table to ensure we can proceed.
If limit reached, reschedule task for after reset_at.
Implement a global function check_and_update_rate_limit(account_id, action_type) that returns next available time or proceeds.
Retries & Error Handling:

On failure (API errors, suspension, rate limits), update tasks.error_log.
If recoverable, retry after a delay.
If unrecoverable (account suspended), mark task and account accordingly.
Proxy & User-Agent Management
Each account has a designated proxy and user-agent.
A get_http_client_for_account(account_id) function:
Returns a configured httpx/aiohttp client with:
HTTP proxy set.
Custom User-Agent header.
Use this client for all Twitter requests from that account.
Validation & Recovery Flows
A dedicated validate_account(account_id) function:

Attempts login using stored credentials, 2FA if needed.
If suspended, tries recovery steps (e.g., visiting login pages, entering codes).
Updates accounts.status field accordingly.
Logs activity in a validation_logs table (optional).
Scheduled (or manual) validation:

A Celery beat (scheduled task) runs every 24 hours to validate accounts if not validated recently.
Manual validation triggers via UI/API.
Frontend Implementation Guidelines
Use Next.js pages for top-level routes:

/accounts - List & manage accounts.
/tasks - Create and monitor tasks.
/analytics - View metrics & charts.
/workflows - Manage predefined workflows.
Use SWR or React Query for data fetching and caching.

For real-time updates, connect to the WebSocket endpoint to receive notifications about tasks and account statuses.

Implement forms for task creation with validation (e.g., specifying the number of tweets to scrape, selecting accounts, etc.).

Responsive design with Tailwind or Material UI’s responsive grid.

Authentication via OAuth login page, store JWT in HTTP-only cookie.

For production:
Containerize each component and deploy on a managed service (e.g., AWS ECS or Kubernetes).
Use a managed Postgres and Redis.
Enable HTTPS and secure secrets via environment variables or secret managers.
